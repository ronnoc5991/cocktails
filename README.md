Hello!

Thank you for taking the time to look through this code.

How to run the solution:

- Clone the repo
- run npm install && npm run dev
- click on the link in the terminal

Or:

- open the file called index.html in the included folder in a browser

Why React?

I chose to use React instead of Vue because I like the 'state in -> DOM out' approach. I am also more familiar with the React ecosystem (e.g. React Router).

Basic Approach:

I tried to follow the principles of atomic design/

Atomic Approach

- Combine small components into larger components
- Allows for reusability
- Keeps components simple

Styles

- Mobile first approach
- SCSS - used for the mixins and functions
