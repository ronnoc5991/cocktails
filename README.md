About development:

Why React?

I chose to use React because I am more familiar with it and its ecosystem and I like the 'state in -> DOM out' approach.

Atomic Approach:

I tried to follow the principles of atomic design, creating simple atoms, combining them to make molecules and organisms, which are ultimately used to structure pages. I tried to keep all of the components simple in order to allow for reusability.

Styles

I chose to use SCSS to take advantage of some mixins and functions. I took a mobile first approach, overwriting/adding to styles on larger screens.
