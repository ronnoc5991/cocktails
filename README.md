About development:

I chose to use React because I am more familiar with it and its ecosystem and I like the 'state in -> DOM out' approach/philosophy. (I also have some experience with Vue)

I tried to follow the principles of atomic design, creating simple atoms, combining them to make molecules and organisms, which are ultimately used to structure pages. I tried to keep all of the components simple in order to allow for reusability.

I chose to use SCSS to take advantage of some mixins and functions.

I took a mobile first approach, overwriting/adding to styles on larger screens.

I used global css variables throughout the app to keep things like spacing consistent and easy to change.
